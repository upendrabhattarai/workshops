This is a one day workshop on Introduction to Command Line Interface. This workshop focuses on teaching basic skills to use the command line interface, specifically `bash`, amd no prior knowledge in command line is required. The lesson goes through navigating the file system, working with files, `for` loops, shell scripting, and positional parameters. This workshop is a prerequisite to a workshop on [RNA-seq analysis](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2/).

Learners are expected to spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Navigate around the command line interface (bash/shell)
2.	Create and manipulate text files 
3.	Submit jobs to a high-performance computing cluster
